## Abstract:

Stock market forecasting has always been challenged by the impact of various external factors on financial markets. Keeping track of all these factors is an arduous and time-consuming task, requiring a high level of expertise. The Iranian stock market is no exception, and despite the existing studies on its prediction, more accurate forecasting is still needed due to the market's dynamic nature. Deep Learning techniques were employed in this study to forecast the Iran Stock Exchange price movements, utilizing the Long Short-Term Memory and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network algorithms to predict the closing price of the stock exchange. Past information is retained during the training process in time series by the LSTM algorithm, resulting in a perfect accuracy score. The predicted closing prices had a Mean Absolute Error of 0.56.
