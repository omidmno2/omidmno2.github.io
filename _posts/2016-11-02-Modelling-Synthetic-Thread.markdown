#Presented at the 12th International Seminar on Polymer Science and Technology.

## Abstract:

For specially constructed thread from synthetic polymers as microfluidic devices and based on the idealized yarn geometry water flow rate was calculated and compared with the measured values. The synthetic yarn can function as microfluidic devices. Nevertheless, for exact prediction of the rate of water transport several parameters such as relative humidity of the surrounding environment, filament cross-section and thread structure, etc. must be taken in to account.
