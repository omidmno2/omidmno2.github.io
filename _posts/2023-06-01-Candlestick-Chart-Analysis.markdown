## Abstract:

Traders in the stock market face various challenges in analysing market conditions and making informed trading decisions. Factors such as news, politics, economic indicators, company performance, investor sentiment, and social media sentiment can significantly impact financial markets, making it difficult for traders to predict stock market movements accurately. However, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have shown promise in improving stock market predictions. This research employs a deep learning approach to forecast the Iran Stock Exchange price movements using a convolutional neural network algorithm. The CNN algorithm requires two-dimensional images as input, and to address this requirement, Python was utilized to convert historical stock price data into candlestick charts for specific days. Transfer learning was also employed to train the model using pre-trained weights from two-dimensional images of candlestick charts. The results of the study show that the CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 algorithms achieved average accuracies of 61.31%, 60.50%, 51.75%, and 59.50%, respectively, in predicting the movement trend of the Tehran stock market. The study demonstrates the potential of using deep learning approaches to improve stock market predictions and provides insight into the effectiveness of different algorithms for this purpose.
