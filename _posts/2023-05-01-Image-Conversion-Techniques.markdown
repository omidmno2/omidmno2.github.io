## Abstract:

The article explores the use of deep learning to enhance the accuracy of trading decisions and minimize the risk of losses in the volatile Tehran stock market. Traditional approaches to financial analysis may lose their efficacy due to the constantly changing nature of financial markets, where the strategies of participating stakeholders shape market trends, further complicating market prediction. This study addresses this challenge by proposing three methods to prepare two-dimensional images for input into a convolutional neural network. The images are labelled either as "buy," "sell," or "hold" indicating the best trading decision, or as "up" or "down" indicating the expected price trend for the next day. The first method uses technical indicators and sliding windows to transform numerical data into 15×15 images, while the second method employs Markov Transition Field (MTF) and Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to generate 2-D 20×20 images. In the third method, technical indicators are used to convert numerical data into 36×10 images, which are then reduced to 10×10 using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The Convolution Neural Network algorithm is used to predict stock price movements, resulting in an average accuracy of 92.23% for data labelled "Buy," "Sell," and "Hold," and 54.31% for data marked "Up" and "Down." The proposed methodology demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques for improving trading decisions and minimizing risks in financial markets.
